Hello everyone, 
This Github is for our capstone project " Plug and Play Visual Landing Aid Accessory for UAVs." 

Let's have fun together.

Kimball will have a meeting with Sightline hardware team to discuss about the layout and make some adjustments. We expect to have a physical board soon.
Tai will work on the test plan for circuit board, clean and update the Github site. 
There are some changes in plan that we decided to change to Mission Planner and use flight simulation rather than physical quadcopter. Then, we will try use SLA-1500 hardware to communicate with the simulation model using serial communication.
